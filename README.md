   - Text documents
   - Mathematics
   - Reports
   - Plots
   - Figures with Tikz
  - [ ] Understand compiler errors

## Pre-Lab
### Install a TeX distribution

On the [Official Website](https://www.latex-project.org/get/#tex-distributions) of the LaTeX project there are always updated links to the various TeX Distributions. We recommend to pick one of these below depending on your operating system.

*Note:* **A full LaTeX distributions needs a few Gigabytes!** You should download and install this in advance before the seminar!
You *may* also install a minimal version, but beware that you may be missing some packages. Though some TeX distributions (like MikTeX) come with a package manager that will allow you to download some packages later.

*Note for Linux users:* You should install texlive through your package manager.
If you are using a Debian / Ubuntu derivate the `texlive` package should install most of what you need.


| Distrubition | OS      | Homepage                              |
|--------------|---------|---------------------------------------|
| TeX Live     | Linux   | https://www.tug.org/texlive/          |
| MacTeX       | MacOS   | https://www.tug.org/mactex/index.html |
| MikTeX       | Windows | https://miktex.org/                   |

### Install a TeX editor

If you don't know which one to pick, TeXWorks is probably the simplest.

*Note:* Your TeX distribution may already include an editor (for ex. TeXShop for MacTeX).
