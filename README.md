## Pre-Lab
### Install a TeX distribution

On the [Official Website](https://www.latex-project.org/get/#tex-distributions) of the LaTeX project there are always updated links to the various TeX Distributions. We recommend to pick one of these below depending on your operating system.

**Note:** A full LaTeX distributions needs a few Gigabytes! You should download and install this in advance before the seminar!

| Distrubition | OS      | Homepage                              |
|--------------|---------|---------------------------------------|
| TeX Live     | Linux   | https://www.tug.org/texlive/          |
| MacTeX       | MacOS   | https://www.tug.org/mactex/index.html |
| MikTeX       | Windows | https://miktex.org/                   |

*Note for Linux users:* You should install texlive through your package manager.
If you are using a Debian / Ubuntu derivate the `texlive` package should install most of what need.

### Install a TeX editor

If you don't know which one to pick, TeXWorks is probably the simplest.

*Note:* Your TeX distribution may already include an editor (for ex. TeXShop for MacTeX).

| Name      | Supported OSs       | Homepage                          |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| TeXWorks  | Linux, Mac, Windows | https://www.tug.org/texworks/     |
| TexMaker  | Linux, Mac, Windows | https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/ |
| TeXStudio | Linux, Mac, Windows | https://www.texstudio.org/        |
